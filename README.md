## Introduction

**Lambert Solver** is a C++ implementation designed to solve Lambert's problem in astrodynamics. Lambert's problem involves determining the orbit that connects two points in space within a specified time of flight under the influence of a central gravitational force. This solver is essential for mission planning, satellite maneuvering, and interplanetary trajectory design.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Solver**: Implements the LambertSolver class to solve Lambert's problem using robust numerical methods.
- **Stumpff Functions**: Accurate computation of Stumpff functions \( C(z) \) and \( S(z) \) for handling various orbital scenarios.
- **Vector Operations**: Efficient and reliable vector mathematics to support orbital calculations.
- **Test Suite**: A suite of test cases validating the solver's accuracy against standard benchmarks.
- **User-Friendly Example**: A demonstration of how to use the LambertSolver class in a practical application.
- **Integrated Development Environment Support**: VS Code configuration for streamlined building and testing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

- **C++ Compiler**: GCC or Clang (supports C++11 or later).
- **CMake** (optional): For managing the build process.
- **VS Code**: With C++ extensions for enhanced development experience.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lambert-solver.git
   cd lambert-solver
   ```

2. **Build the Project**

   You can use the provided VS Code tasks or compile manually using `g++`.

   - **Using VS Code Tasks**

     - Open the project in VS Code.
     - Press `Ctrl+Shift+B` to build the project using the predefined tasks in `.vscode/tasks.json`.

   - **Manual Compilation**

     ```bash
     mkdir build
     cd build
     g++ -std=c++11 ../src/lamberts_solver.cpp ../src/helloworld.cpp -I../include -o lambert_solver
     ```

3. **Verify the Build**

   After successful compilation, the executable `lambert_solver` will be located in the `build` directory or the `bin` folder, depending on your build configuration.

## Usage

### Running the Example

The `helloworld.cpp` file provides a simple demonstration of how to use the `LambertSolver` class to solve Lambert's problem.

1. **Navigate to the Build Directory**

   ```bash
   cd build
   ```

2. **Run the Executable**

   ```bash
   ./lambert_solver
   ```

   **Expected Output:**

   ```
   Solving Lambert's problem...
   Velocity at r1: (vx1, vy1, vz1) km/s
   Velocity at r2: (vx2, vy2, vz2) km/s
   ```

   Replace `(vx1, vy1, vz1)` and `(vx2, vy2, vz2)` with the actual computed velocity vectors.

## Testing

A comprehensive test suite is provided to validate the accuracy and robustness of the Lambert solver across various scenarios.

### Running Tests

1. **Navigate to the Tests Directory**

   ```bash
   cd tests
   ```

2. **Compile the Test Suite**

   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++11 test_lambert_solver.cpp ../src/lamberts_solver.cpp -I../include -o test_lambert_solver
   ```

3. **Execute the Tests**

   ```bash
   ./test_lambert_solver
   ```

   **Expected Output:**

   ```
   Running Lambert Solver Tests...
   Test Case 1: Vallado Example 5-5 - Passed
   Test Case 2: Curtis Example 5.2 - Passed
   Test Case 3: Short Transfer (Quarter Orbit) - Passed
   Test Case 4: Long Transfer (Three-Quarter Orbit) - Passed
   All tests passed successfully!
   ```

   If any test fails, detailed information will be provided to facilitate debugging.
